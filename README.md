# Tip Calculator

Calculating a tip can be a tricky business, especially when multiple people will be splitting the tip. Use this handy app to calculate the tip you want to leave. Simply enter the cost of the meal, select the percentage for the tip you would like to leave, enter the number of people splitting the tip and submit the information. The tip amount will be shown at the bottom of the display area.

For ease of use, radio buttons displaying standard tip amounts are available. Or, just select 'other' to enter any desired tip percentage. 

By default, the tip will be generated assuming a single person is paying the bill. However, the tip may be calcuated for any number of people splitting the bill.
